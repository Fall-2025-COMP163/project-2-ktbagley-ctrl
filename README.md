# COMP 163 - Project 2: Character Abilities Showcase

---------

# MY PROJECT OVERVIEW: Kayla Bagley 


# WHAT I IMPLEMENTED
I created a three inheritance level structure by Character, Player, and Warrior/Mage/Rogue. 
Character was the base class that stored name, health, strength, and magic. I defined all these with the functions, attack(), take_damage(), and display_stats(). 
Player, which was inherited from Character, I added speicifc player information like character class, level, and experience. I also overrided display_stats() to show the additional attributes the player had. 
Finally, which was inherited from the Player, is either the Warrior, Mage or Rouge. Each of these subclasses had its own stats distributed with a special ability that was unlike each other. The warrior had the power_strike, the mage had the fireball, and the rogue had the sneak_attack. 
I also added a Weapon class where characters can add weapons but it is not included in the inheritance chain and cannot be inherited from any of them. 

# BONUS FEATURES 
The only feature I added was the possibility to have weapons in the game that don't have to be involved in the  3 level chain I implemented. 

# AI USUAGE
Google Gemini - Helped me to understand the critical hit mechanice inside the rogue.attack. Needed to include import random at the top of my file for the critical hits to generate. Also GG helped me to see I missed a parenthesis in my warrior.attack method, because one test case wouldn't pass.

# HOW TO RUN 
python project2_starter.py, pytest

# CHAIN 
Character  
│  
Player  
    - Warrior  
    - Mage  
    - Rogue

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a simple character system that demonstrates mastery of object-oriented programming fundamentals: inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, and composition. This project focuses on core OOP concepts without the complexity of a full game system.

## 📋 Getting Started

1. **Complete your implementation** in `project2_starter.py`
2. **Test your code** by running: `python project2_starter.py`
3. **Run automated tests** with: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
4. **Commit and push** to see GitHub test results

## 🏗️ What You're Building

### **Class Structure (6 Classes Total)**

```
Character (base class)
    ↓
Player (inherits from Character)  
    ↓
Warrior, Mage, Rogue (inherit from Player)

Weapon (composition - separate class)
```

### **Required Stats for Each Class:**

| Class   | Health | Strength | Magic | Special Ability |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Warrior | 120    | 15       | 5     | Power Strike    |
| Mage    | 80     | 8        | 20    | Fireball        |
| Rogue   | 90     | 12       | 10    | Sneak Attack    |

## 🎮 Core Functionality

### **All Characters Must Have:**
- `attack(target)` - Basic attack method
- `take_damage(damage)` - Reduce health
- `display_stats()` - Print character information

### **Players Additionally Have:**
- `character_class` attribute (like "Warrior", "Mage")
- `level` and `experience` attributes
- Enhanced `display_stats()` that shows player info

### **Special Abilities (Each Class):**
- **Warrior**: `power_strike(target)` - High damage attack
- **Mage**: `fireball(target)` - Magic damage attack
- **Rogue**: `sneak_attack(target)` - Critical hit attack

### **Weapons (Composition):**
- `Weapon(name, damage_bonus)` - Characters can HAVE weapons
- `display_info()` - Show weapon information

## ✅ Testing Your Code

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_inheritance.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_method_overriding.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_special_abilities.py -v

# Test your main program
python project2_starter.py
```

### **GitHub Testing**

After pushing your code, check the **Actions** tab to see automated test results:

- ✅ **Inheritance Tests** (20 points) - Class structure and inheritance chain
- ✅ **Method Overriding Tests** (20 points) - Polymorphism and customized methods
- ✅ **Special Abilities Tests** (15 points) - Character abilities and composition

## 🎮 Example Usage

Your program should work like this:

```python
# Create characters (inheritance)
warrior = Warrior("Marcus")
mage = Mage("Aria")  
rogue = Rogue("Shadow")

# Polymorphism - same method, different behavior
for character in [warrior, mage, rogue]:
    character.attack(target)  # Each attacks differently

# Special abilities
warrior.power_strike(enemy)
mage.fireball(enemy)
rogue.sneak_attack(enemy)

# Composition
sword = Weapon("Iron Sword", 15)
sword.display_info()

# Test battle system (provided for you)
battle = SimpleBattle(warrior, mage)
battle.fight()
```

## 🎲 SimpleBattle System (Provided)

You have a **SimpleBattle** class already written that you can use to test your characters:

```python
battle = SimpleBattle(character1, character2)
battle.fight()  # Simulates a simple battle
```

**⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY the SimpleBattle class** - it's provided for testing your implementations.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Protected Files**
- **DO NOT MODIFY** files in the `tests/` directory
- **DO NOT MODIFY** the `SimpleBattle` class
- Modifying protected files will result in automatic academic integrity violation

### **AI Usage Policy**
- ✅ **Allowed**: AI assistance for implementation, debugging, learning
- 📝 **Required**: Document AI usage in code comments
- 🎯 **Must be able to explain**: Every class and method during interview

## 🏆 Grading

- **Inheritance Tests (20%)**: Proper 3-level inheritance chain
- **Method Overriding (20%)**: Polymorphism and customized behaviors
- **Special Abilities (15%)**: Character-specific methods and composition
- **Code Quality (5%)**: Professional comments and documentation
- **Interview (40%)**: Code explanation and live coding

## 🎨 Bonus Creative Elements

Feel free to add your own creative touches for bonus points:
- Additional character classes beyond the three required
- More weapon types with different properties
- Enhanced special abilities with unique effects
